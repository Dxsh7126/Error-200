Our project is an AI-powered drone and social media based disaster detection system designed to assist in real-time monitoring and assessment during natural disasters. Using a live video feed from the drone, our system identifies and reports key disaster indicators such as floods, fires, and earthquake-related damage. We used an AI model called YOLO which helps in detection of humans. 

This project is highly useful from our perspective because it addresses the need for rapid, real-time disaster monitoring and response, which is critical in minimizing damage and saving lives. We can use the help of the public as well to save lives. 

To begin, users must install the required dependencies such as OpenCV, NumPy, and the YOLO model for human detection. After that, they can launch the script, which opens a window showing live footage from the drone with labeled bounding boxes and real-time detection alerts. The system logs each detection with time and coordinates for later analysis or reporting. The users can also just upload pictures or videos and change the name in the code for our social media part.

The project is maintained and contributed by the core team which is the four of us. Each member contributed in each vital part of the project.
